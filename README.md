==================
The best repo ever :D

Code Style:
-----------
Well styled code is REALLY important for readability. Please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Never have more than one empty line between lines of code.
- Use empty lines to separate distinct blocks of code from one another.
- If it is not 100% clear what a method does, add a comment.
- Spaces go between pretty much everything.
- Use tabs. *Never* indent using spaces.
- Everything inside a block should be indented.
- Don't forget semicolons, even though they are often optional they make code more readable an less prone to mistakes.
- Close all HTML singleton tags with a /.
- Close all HTML tags.
- I'm sure there are other things that should be here, so keep an eye on this page :)

Development Style:
------------------
Everything that goes into the main branch of this project should work perfectly. It doesn't have to be complete but it shouldn't have bugs in it.
- Create a branch for new stuff. Once you are done (what you were working on is bug free) merge it with the master branch and submit a pull request.
- Pull from this 'master' repo often. Everything works better if everyone has the most up to date code to work with.
- If something that someone else is working with is causing problems for you make an issue on GitHub.
- Check the issues on GitHub often to make sure that there is nothing there for you.
